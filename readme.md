Emotional Artificial Intelligence
=================================

Proof-of-concept for an emotional conversational user interface about book reviews.

What is it?
-----------

This project is simple demo of designing emotion into an artificial intelligence conversational UI. The demo consists of a chatbot interface for retrieving book reviews. The user can interact with the software in a conversational UI style, by typing and chatting with the software.

Responses from the chatbot are triggered by specific keywords and phrases.

Phrases that contain emotionally charged words (from a preset list of keywords) are responded according to neutral, positive, or negative sentiment of the user.

Each potential response from the conversational UI consists of three potential sentences, according to the sentiment of the user.

Why?
----

Sentiment analysis is approaching 80+% accuracy, nearly exceeding that of a human! When a computer can detect the sentiment of a user within a software system, it can interact with the user in a much more human-like fashion. Utilizing and responding to the emotional state of the user can help bring humans and computers even closer together. Imagine.. what a world!
